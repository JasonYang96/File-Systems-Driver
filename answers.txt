We passed all 17 test cases. We did several tests for ourselves. We tested
symlinks to make sure that deleting symlinks did not delete the file. We
also tested hardlinks to make sure that the ionode number was the same, 
as well as being able to delete hardlinks without deleting original data.

We also tested to make sure we could make big files and process the cat image
correctly. Tested some more read and write and decided we have throughly found
all the bugs for this lab.
